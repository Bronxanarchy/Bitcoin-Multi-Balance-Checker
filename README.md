Orjinal File by : xcbtrader at : https://github.com/xcbtrader/multi-balance-checker

Check the balance of bitcoin addresses in the text file using multiple API

The program allows you to control the balance of many bitcoin addresses as in the text file you want when you start the program. Up to 14 different APIs are used to control the balance and therefore avoid being banned by the provider.


The file must contain the current bitcoin addresses and must be one (without spaces) in each row.

The program is designed for python3, not for python 2.7
